#+TITLE: TayFrame

Python based functions for analyzing timeseries financial data. This project was an exercise to see I could perform the
same common operations on timeseries data as many are used to, while keeping the following goals in mind:

+ **No Pandas (or any other major dependency):** Not allowed to use any major frameworks to make life easier.
+ **Try to avoid any traditional if/for loops:** I wanted to force myself to think differently about how to accomplish
  the same task within these limitations. This goal resulted in the use of a lot of functional paradigms and list
  comprehesions (and some ugly looking code).

**Disclaimer:** No claims that any of the code in this repo is perfomant or correct.
